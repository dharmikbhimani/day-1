        <h1>&lt;h1&gt;<br>The Scoop on HTML,XML,XHTML,HTML5</h1>

        <h2>&lt;h2&gt;<br>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):--</h2>
        <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It's a set of codes that web browsers interpret to display text, images, links, and other elements on a webpage. HTML documents consist of a series of elements, each enclosed in angle brackets ("&lt; &gt;"), and these elements are used to define the structure and content of a webpage. HTML has gone through various versions, with HTML5 being the latest and most advanced version.</p>

        <h2>&lt;h2&gt; <br>XML (eXtensible Markup Language):--</h2>
        <p>XML is a markup language similar to HTML, but it is more flexible and designed to store and transport data, rather than display it. XML focuses on describing the structure and organization of data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It's widely used for data interchange between applications, as well as configuration files, RSS feeds, and more. Unlike HTML, which has predefined tags for specific purposes, XML allows developers to define their own tags.</p>

        <h2>&lt;h2&gt;<br>XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language):--</h2>
        <p>XHTML is a stricter and cleaner version of HTML that follows the rules and syntax of XML. It was introduced to bridge the gap between the flexibility of HTML and the strictness of XML. XHTML documents must adhere to XML rules, such as using lowercase tags, properly nesting elements, and closing all tags. XHTML was an important step towards the development of HTML5 and helped pave the way for a more standardized and consistent web. </p>

        <h2>&lt;h2&gt;<br>HTML5:--</h2>
        <p>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and includes a wide range of new features and enhancements aimed at improving the user experience on the web.</p>

        <h3>&lt;h3&gt;<br>Some key features of HTML5 include:</h3>

        <h4>&lt;h4&gt;<br>Semantic Elements:</h4>
        <p> HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;, <br>which provide clearer structure to web content.</p>

        <h4>&lt;h4&gt;<br>Multimedia Support:</h4>
        <p>HTML5 includes native support for audio and video, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash.</p>

        <h4>&lt;h4&gt;<br>Canvas and SVG:</h4>
        <p>HTML5 introduces the "&lt;canvas&gt;" element for creating dynamic graphics and animations,<br> and it also supports Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for resolution-independent images.</p>

        <h4>&lt;h4&gt;<br>Form Enhancements:</h4>
        <p>New form input types (e.g., &lt;input type="email"&gt;, &lt;input type="date"&gt;) and attributes (e.g., required, placeholder) <br> make building forms more powerful and user-friendly.</p>

        <h4>&lt;h4&gt;<br>Geolocation API:</h4>
        <p>HTML5 provides a Geolocation API that allows websites to access a user's geographic location.</p>

        <h4>&lt;h4&gt;<br>Web Storage and Web Workers:</h4>
        <p>HTML5 introduces mechanisms for local storage of data (Web Storage) and running scripts in the background <br>(Web Workers), enhancing web application capabilities.</p>

        <h5>&lt;h5&gt;<br>HTML5 has played a crucial role in making the web more versatile and responsive to modern web development needs.</h5>

        <h6>&lt;h6&gt;<br>NOTE:</h6>
        <p>Remember that while HTML and XML are fundamental technologies for web content and data interchange, they serve different purposes. <br>XHTML is a stricter variant of HTML, and HTML5 is the latest and most feature-rich version of HTML.</p>

        <h3>Now Let Us Discuss About "iframe" :</h3>
        <p>The ("&lt;Iframe&gt;") tag specifies an inline frame.<br> An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.</p>
